          <p className="text-lg">
            We've built a platform that allows autonomous agents to interact with forms via voice, SMS, and email. Our goal isn't to automate away your least expensive employeesâ€”we believe that's counterproductive in the long term. Instead, we want to help teams create new and innovative workflows that drive new revenue.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            We believe your support team should evolve into VIP support to deliver exceptional value. Your agents don't replace support; they become your customer's sidekick, helping them interact with your business in the most efficient way possible.
